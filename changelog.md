0.0.4
- The getPlayer() function has been extended. It is given two optional parameters.
The change affects the:
- bridge/esx/client.lua (getPlayer)
- bridge/esx/shared.lua (convertPlayer)

- bridge/qb/client.lua (getPlayer)
- bridge/qb/shared.lua (convertPlayer)
The changes do not affect the standalone folder. Always copy and overwrite (if necessary) the functions of eCore there!
